# BinarySearchTree
Binary Search Tree created with Generics. The generic type is upperbounded by the Comparable interface so it can be used with any <br />
object that implements that interface. 

## Work in progress

### Things to do:
- Write functionaility for balancing the tree
- Write more utility methods as needed
- Potentally replace the Comparable interface with the ability to pass a comparator for sorting
- Make the BST extend the Collection interface to allow it to be more consistant with Java standards
