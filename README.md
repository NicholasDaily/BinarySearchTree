# BinarySearchTree
Binary Search Tree created with Generics. The generic type is upperbounded by the Comparable interface so it can be used with any <br />
object that implements that interface.  <br />

Binary search trees are data structures that are useful for sorting a set of data, they implement sorting and traversal algorithms. Balanced binary search trees are excellent tools for quick insertion and retrieval of elements and that's the end goal of this project. 

## Work in progress

### Things to do:
- Write functionaility for balancing the tree
- Write more utility methods as needed
- Potentally replace the Comparable interface with the ability to pass a comparator for sorting
- Make the BST extend the Collection interface to allow it to be more consistant with Java standards
